# Portuguese (PT-Nativo) keyboard layout files

## macOS (.keylayout)

To install, simply copy `Portuguese (PT-Nativo).keylayout` to
`/Library/Keyboard Layouts`.

### Notes

- This is not an exact replica: only the keys that I actually use were
  ported.  On the other hand, this includes support for `ä`, `ö` and
  `ü`, via `Option-a`, `Option-o` and `Option-u`.
  
- Built with `Ukelele`
